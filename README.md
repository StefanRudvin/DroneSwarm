# DroneSwarm
Optimizing the average vessel turnaround time for ports using distributed drone swarms.
Developed using two Genetic Algorithms and the Unity Framework. The drones act in a distributed fashion each with their own agent.
Movement is handled via layers of 2D navmeshes for collision avoidance.

## Genetic Algorithms:

* Optimize the Container Stowage Problem (CSP) with 20 containers per ship. Each container has a weight and priority.
* Optimize the movement of the drones to optimize the vessel turnaround time. Each ship has a priority and assigned containers.

This is my Bachelor Dissertation for my Bachelor of Computing Science degree at the University of Aberdeen.
